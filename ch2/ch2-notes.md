# Fundamentals of Computer Science - Chapter 2

## 2.1 Variables
- Numbers and characters are important data types in almost all Python programs
- When creating programs, they will store values to be used later
- In Python, these values are stored in items called variables
### Defining Variables
- Variables are storage locations in a computer program, which have a name and hold a value
- Think of variables as a parking space in a parking garage, with a name and a value
- Assignment statements are used to place a value into a variable
- Left hand side of an assignment statement consist of the variable name, the right hand side is an expression that has a value
  - The value is what is stored in the variable
- After the variable has been defined, it can be used in other statements
- If existing variable is assigned a new value, that replaces the previous contents
- The `=` sign in the assignment operator is not the same as the algebraic `=` (which denotes equality)
### Number Types
- 
### Definitions
- `variable`: symbol in a program that identifies a storage location that can hold different values
- `assignment`: placing a new value into a variable
